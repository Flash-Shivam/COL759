There are 3 cpp files part2.cpp , part3.cpp , decipher.cpp .
part2.cpp (obtains key for keylength = 2)
part3.cpp (obtains key for keylength = 3)
decipher.cpp (writes plaintext from the key obtained).


How to run for key length = 2;

first the cipher text must be present in ciphertext.txt .
--------------------
g++ -o part2 part2.cpp

./part2

in re

g++ -o decipher decipher.cpp

2

--------------------

after executing ./part2

we get the key in key.txt file .

in line 15 "in","re" are the digraphs .(most occurring one is the first).

the output plaintext is obtained in output.text

How to run for key length = 3;

first the cipher text must be present in ciphertext.txt .
--------------------
g++ -o part3 part3.cpp

./part3

the and tha

g++ -o decipher decipher.cpp

3

--------------------

after executing ./part3

we get the key in key.txt file .


in line 39 "the","and","tha" are the trigraphs .(most occurring one is the first).

the output plaintext is obtained in output.text
